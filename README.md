# AIGenC Main RL Loop

This repository implements the core reinforcement learning (RL) loop for the AIGenC frameworkâ€”our computational model for functional creativity in RL agents, applied in the CREATE and Minigrid environment.

## ðŸ”§ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CatarauCorina/aigenc_main_rl_loop.git
cd aigenc_main_rl_loop
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

How It Works

The agent encodes the current state into a structured graph.

It queries long-term memory using SETLE to retrieve relevant subgraphs.

Retrieved graphs are filtered (e.g., by attention) and added to working memory.

A deep RL agent takes enriched inputs and outputs an action.

The environment responds with a new state and reward.

The working memory is optionally updated, and the process continues.
